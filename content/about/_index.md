Hey there!

I'm Larissa, currently doing the [Mannheim Master of Data Science](http://www.wim.uni-mannheim.de/de/fakultaet/studiengaenge/msc-in-data-science/) program in the 3rd semester. Due to various projects within and besides required university courses I came across different solution strategies for data mining projects. In the last semesters I worked with: 

+ Python and various libraries like [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [scikit learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) or [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/).
+ RapidMiner (Certified Analyst)
+ Stata
+ R

Before working in the field of Data Science, I did my Bachelor in Political Science, also at the University of Mannheim. Courses at working with Social Media usage data (and the Twitter API) or election data made me curious for the world of Data Science. Besides studying and doing projects, I'm very interested in Crocheting, Literature and Writing. 

Feel free to [contact](/contact/) me!
